    - author: Michael von Pidoll
      position: TÜV Rheinland AG
      quote: The JTBD methodology was communicated in a very understandable way, and the interviews were conducted in a very professional manner. The project offers us the chance to address our customers with new service offers in a more targeted way.

    - author: Manuel Gerding
      position: steadybit
      quote: We went from zero practical experience with JTBD to an operational small research team that can use JTBD independently in the future within 2 weeks! An unrestricted 110% recommendation.

    - author: Stefan Hück
      position: Mantrafant
      quote: We particularly liked the systematic and structured approach, so that we learned more relevant information about our product and our customers in the JTBD Interview Sprint in just 2 days (6 interviews) than in the previous 3 years. After less than a week, we were able to directly triple our advertising campaign effectiveness with the results. Not only did we improve our marketing and sales, but we also got a better product out of it.
