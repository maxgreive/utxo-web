    - author: Michael von Pidoll
      position: TÜV Rheinland AG
      quote: The JTBD methodology was communicated very clearly and the interviews were conducted professionally. The project gives us the opportunity to address our customers more specifically with new service offerings.

    - author: Manuel Gerding
      position: steadybit
      quote: Within two weeks we have gone from zero practical experience with JTBD to a fully operational small research team that can use JTBD independently in the future! Unreserved 110% recommendation.

    - author: Stefan Hück
      position: Mantrafant
      quote: We particularly liked the systematic and structured approach, which enabled us to find out more relevant information about our product and our customers in the JTBD interview sprint in just two days (6 interviews) than in the last three years. After less than a week, we were able to directly triple the effectiveness of our advertising campaign with the results. Not only did we improve our marketing and sales, but we also developed a better product.
