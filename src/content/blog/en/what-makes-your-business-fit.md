### Success is the combination of a lot of things going right

Here is the basic idea of a working business:

1. You have a great product or service
2. People buy your product
3. You make more money on the product then you spend

But getting there needs a lot of puzzle pieces to fit.

Here are the 5 major fits to achieve

1. Problem-Solution Fit
2. Product-Market Fit
3. Product-Language Fit
4. Product-Business Fit
5. Business-culture Fit

### To have a successfull business, you need them all. So let's break them down.
Problem solution fit

Is there an actual problem that your solving?

#### **Example**

**Problem:** Help me to feel awake

**Solution:** Take a nap or drink a coffee

### Product market fit

- Do you have something, people can buy?
- Does it solve their problem?
- Does it provide more value then it costs?
- Does it reach them where and when they have the problem?

This is problem solution fit combined with:

- Something people can buy
- A price
- A target audience
- A meaningful context

#### Example 1

- A freshly brewed coffee
- 2€
- For students
- At a small cafè in front of the university so students come buy

#### Example 2

- A bag of coffee beans
- 10€ the kilo
- Sold in a hipster-cafe
- Framed as high quality and very tasteful

### Product language fit

How to talk about your product so customer see the value?

#### Example

You could name the first example coffee "best budget coffee to-go"

You could name the second example "Organic barrista home beans"

The names convey the value propositon. Description and value need to match. 

### Product business fit

Can you deliver the product in a profitable and reliable way?

This is basically everything from the business model canvas for a product. Your business needs to match your product.

### Business culture fit

Every people is a people business. You need the right people with the right mindset.

- Your problem defines your market
- Your market defines your product
- Your product defines your business

But your people define your business as well. Hire for the people your product needs.
