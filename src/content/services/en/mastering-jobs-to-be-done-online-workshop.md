  - question: "Is it bad if I can't make it to one of the modules?"
    answer: "The workshops build on each other, so skipping individual workshop modules can lead to comprehension problems. However, as we know that it can always happen that you can't make it to an unplanned date, we offer 1on1 recap sessions for 200€."
  - question: "How many people can take part, how many places are available?"
    answer: "There are still places available for this workshop. However, no more than 10 participants will take part."
  - question: "In which language will the workshop be held?"
    answer: "This workshop will be held in German most of the time. However, we conduct english ones. You can sign up for the waitlist at <a href=\"mailto:masterclass@utxo.solutions\">masterclass@utxo.solutions</a>."
  - question: "I can't make it this time. Will you do it again?"
    answer: "Yes, we'll definitely do it again. Just enter the waitlist and you will be notified. Just mail us at <a href=\"mailto:masterclass@utxo.solutions\">masterclass@utxo.solutions</a>"

      <ul>
        <li>If you book very early</li>
        <li>If you book for more than one person</li>
